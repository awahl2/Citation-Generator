This project was created because I had a bibliography due in a few hours, but the citation website crashed so I put it together fairly quickly to ensure that I got my assignment in on time. I'm sure other students have had the same issue so here's something to help. It was also a great way to practice what I had learned in class so feel free to check it out.

## ▷ How To Run :
As it is a simple program, simply run it, and it will prompt the user to input the information as necessary to cite their sources.

## ▷ How To Edit This Project For Personal Use :
Due to the fact that this is a fairly small project, I would definitely recommend that you make a copy and rename it before you edit as needed. There isn't much outside that in terms of instructions.

## ▷ Known Issues (Work In Progress) And Updates :
This project is ongoing. Currently, I am working to add other common citation styles such as MLA citations onto the list. It will be complete soon, but as I am a student, I do have to prioritize my studies.
